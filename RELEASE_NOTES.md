# Common Theme Release workflow

## Release Notes
- Frequency of releases
    - Major release: rare (Example: paradigm change)
    - Minor release: monthly (Example: breaking changes, documentation, fixes)
    - Patch release: as and when (Example: small features)
- Dependencies
    - are ignored in release documentation
- New contributors
    - are automatically listed in the release notes
- New categories in the release notes
    - (1) can be created by adding a label to the repo
    - (2) update [release.yml](.github/release.yml) file with [labels](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/common-theme/labels) in the appropriate category
- common-theme will follow the 2-cycle deprecation:
    - Version n: Introduce deprecation
    - Version n+1: Deprecation stays
    - Version n+2: Add breaking change removing deprecation
- Breaking changes
    - means the user cannot build their site when the only change made is updating the common-theme version

- [ ] Add a line to the release notes to credit the release manager
- [ ] Run a test build with the new release to ensure no major errors or bugs
- [ ] List out, as concretely as possible, any steps users have to take when they upgrade beyond just dumping the dependency.
- [ ] Write pseudocode that highlights what code should change and how.
- [ ] Call out if it is recommended that users upgrade because of known problems with older releases.
